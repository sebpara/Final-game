- My game idea is about magical beasts living in a jungle trying to protect their home from the evil humans that are attacking it.

- The main character The main "hero" of the game is a magical beast and the enemy are humans.

- The magical beast will try to protect itself and it's home from the evil humans that are trying to destroy it. The human's goal is to destroy the beasts home.

- In order to win this game, You need to defeat every human that is attacking utill they are all gone. If you lose the game it's because the humans achieved to destroy your home and you will be defeated.

- The game only has 1 level.

- This game pitch is inspired by Brandon Lee Felix (https://github.com/Vapidx4/dryadsEnvy).
